The Vehicle CNG Booking project in Java aims to enable the remote booking of Vehicle CNG. It consists of three modules: Admin, CNG Pump, and User. The Admin module allows administrators to approve and delete CNG Pumps from the list, ensuring proper management and control. The other modules include functionalities for CNG Pumps and Users, facilitating a seamless booking process.
